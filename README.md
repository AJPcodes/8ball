# 8ball
Magic 8 ball app, made with Ionic and ngCordova plugins

This project was to practice using Ionic and ngCordova in order to interact with native smart phone technology. 
It responds to being shaken with an animation and a randomly selected response. 

You can try it out by running it on a localhost server or feel free to poke around the code. It's pretty simple.
